## Description

I completed a PSD to HTML conversion project, where I received a design file and extracted the necessary images. The project's requirements included ensuring the website's full responsiveness. Specifically, I implemented a responsive carousel using a snippet from bootsnipp.com, and for mobile screens, I utilized Bootstrap to transform the carousel into an accordion, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices.
